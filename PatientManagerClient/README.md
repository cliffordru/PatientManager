## INSTALLING THE CODE

The following are  instructions for installing the code.

0) Ensure you have node installed.

   At a command prompt, type `node -v` to ensure you have version `14.15.0` or higher before proceeding.

1) Download or clone the code from this repository.

   If you download as a zip file, be sure to unzip it.

2) Navigate to the PatientManagerClient folder.

   There should be a package.json file in this folder.

3) In a command window (or the Command prompt in VS Code), type `npm install`.

   This creates a node_modules folder and installs all packages from the package.json file into that folder. You may see a few warnings during this process, but you should not see any errors.

   ** Before proceeding, you should ensure the PatientManagerService is running.  Please refer to the [PatientManagerService\README.md](../PatientManagerService/README.md) file in the PatientManagerService folder for instructions. 
   
4) In the same command window (or the Command property in VS Code), type `npm start` or `ng serve -o`.

   The application should then compile and launch in your default browser if you used `ng serve -o` else look for the URL in the command window and type it into your browser.
